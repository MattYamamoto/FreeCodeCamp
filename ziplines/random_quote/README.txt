 FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Projects - Zipline

My take on a random quote machine.  I altered the user stories for the FreeCodeCamp zipline for my design; therefore I do not have buttons to press in order to generate a quote or tweet the content.  However, this was my design choice.

I feel like some of the code is a bit...messy.  I'm still new at this though, and am happy with a working result, even if the code is not the most efficient.  I'm not sure if using jQuery's queues is the best way to achieve the line by line animation effect, however, it was the simplest way I was able to make the effect work. 

Leave me some comments if you have any constructive criticism, Thanks!
