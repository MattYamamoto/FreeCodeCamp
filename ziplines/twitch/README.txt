Zipline: Use the Twitch.tv JSON API

This web app initializes with a preset list of twitch channels (or users, or streams...honestly, I don't use twitch enough to know the difference).  You can filter the channels by status as well as search through your list of users.  Additionally, you can add a users to the list (and the page will do it's best to suggest users based on your input).

For now, I'm satisfied enough for this zipline; however, I would like this to be more mobile responsive (for example, find an alternative for the hover delete buttons), and I would like to fix small issues (such as the add user suggestion dropdown not having the appropriate matching width).  Oh, I'd like it to keep state using cookies or some sort of local storage.  But, as I said, I'm pretty happy with what I've done given my experience thus far.
